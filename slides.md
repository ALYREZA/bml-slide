SLIDE 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT
===============================================================================
Purpose: Establish urgency and need for change
Key Message: Current market demands speed, traditional methods are too risky
Duration: 3 minutes
Notes: Use the Formula 1 analogy to make it memorable and relatable
Talk Points:
- Market moves faster than ever before

# Why Change is Essential

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-8 text-left">

<div>

## Market Reality
- <carbon-rocket /> **Speed is everything**
- <carbon-user-multiple /> **Rising expectations**
- <carbon-chart-line /> **Constant evolution required**

</div>

<div v-click>

## Current Risks
- <carbon-building /> **Building on assumptions**
- <carbon-currency-dollar /> **High cost of failure**
- <carbon-time /> **Slow to adapt**

</div>

SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION FRAMEWORK
===============================================================================
Purpose: Present the four key shifts needed for transformation
Key Message: Four fundamental changes: mindset, teams, process, innovation
Duration: 4 minutes
Notes: This is the core of our proposal - emphasize these are proven approaches
Talk Points:
- Projects â†’ Products (continuous evolution)
- Feature factories â†’ Empowered teams (problem ownership)
- Big bets â†’ Build-Measure-Learn (risk reduction)
- Safe zone â†’ Structured innovation (competitive advantage)
===============================================================================
-->

# The Solution

## Mindset Shift
From finite **Projects** with end dates...
to living **Products** that evolve continuously.

<div v-click class="mt-8">

## Team Shift
From "Feature Factories" executing tasks...
to **Empowered Teams** solving customer problems.

</div>

::right::

<div v-click>

## Process Shift
From big bets based on assumptions...
to **Build-Measure-Learn** cycles using data.

</div>

<div v-click class="mt-8">

## Innovation Shift
From "safe zone" predictable ideas...
to structured exploration of breakthrough concepts.

</div>

<!--
Four key shifts transform how we work: mindset, teams, process, and innovation approach.

SLIDE 4: BUILD-MEASURE-LEARN METHODOLOGY
===============================================================================
Purpose: Explain the core methodology that reduces risk and increases success
Key Message: Scientific approach prevents massive failures through early learning
Duration: 4 minutes
Notes: This is THE key differentiator - emphasize cost/time savings
Talk Points:
- BUILD: Small MVPs in weeks not months
- MEASURE: Real user data, not opinions or assumptions
- LEARN: Make informed decisions based on evidence
- Result: Prevents $500K failures with $30K experiments
===============================================================================

SLIDE 5: EMPOWERED TEAMS APPROACH
===============================================================================
Purpose: Show how team structure changes drive better outcomes
Key Message: Problem-solving teams vs feature-building teams produce superior results
Duration: 3 minutes
Notes: Use the concrete example to make this tangible and relatable
Talk Points:
- Old: Teams get feature lists to execute
- New: Teams get problems to solve and own the outcome
- Example: "Build search filter" vs "Reduce discovery time by 50%"
- Result: Creativity, ownership, and better business outcomes
===============================================================================
-->

# Empowered Teams

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4">

<div>

## Old Way
- <carbon-list-checked /> Given feature lists
- <carbon-settings /> Execute orders
- <carbon-user /> No ownership

</div>

<div v-click>

## New Way
- <carbon-bullhorn /> Given problems to solve
- <carbon-idea /> Discover best solutions
- <carbon-user-multiple /> Full ownership

</div>

</div>

<div v-click class="mt-6">

**Example:** Instead of "Build a search filter"...
say **"Reduce product discovery time by 50%"**

This unlocks creativity and drives better outcomes.

</div>

<!--
Empowered teams that own problems create better solutions than teams that just execute feature lists.

SLIDE 7: OBJECTION HANDLING
===============================================================================
Purpose: Proactively address the two main concerns/objections
Key Message: Address cost/predictability and outsourcing concerns directly
Duration: 3 minutes
Notes: These are the likely pushback points - handle them confidently
Talk Points:
- Predictability concern: Fixed price is an illusion, real risk is building wrong thing
- Our approach: Small investments to validate before big commitments
- Outsourcing concern: Core product is strategic asset, learning stays in-house
- Result: Lower total cost and competitive advantage we control
===============================================================================
-->

# Addressing Concerns

## "This seems unpredictable and expensive"

<div v-click>

- Fixed price is an **illusion of predictability**
- We spend little to **validate ideas** first
- **Total cost of success is lower** than one big failure

</div>

::right::

## "Why not just outsource?"

<div v-click>

- Core product is the **brain of our business**
- **Learning** is our most valuable asset
- Creates **strategic advantage** competitors can't copy

</div>

<!--
We manage risk differently - small investments to validate before big commitments.

SLIDE 8: THE ASK - PILOT PROGRAM
===============================================================================
Purpose: Present a low-risk, concrete next step that's easy to approve
Key Message: Not asking for major commitment, just a small experiment to prove value
Duration: 2 minutes
Notes: This is the close - make it easy for them to say yes
Talk Points:
- Small, controlled experiment approach
- 90-day timeline with clear deliverables
- Low budget, high learning potential
- Results will speak for themselves
- Emphasize: Scientific experiment, not leap of faith
===============================================================================
-->

# Proposed 90-Day Pilot

<div v-click class="mt-8">

## Simple Experiment
- <carbon-user-multiple /> Form one empowered team
- <carbon-search /> Give them a business problem to solve
- <carbon-chart-line /> Small budget, 3-month timeline
- <carbon-document /> Present learnings and next steps

</div>

SLIDE 9: QUESTIONS & DISCUSSION
===============================================================================
Purpose: Open the floor for discussion and address any remaining concerns
Key Message: Ready to move forward with this strategic transformation
Duration: 10+ minutes
Notes: This is where the real conversation happens - be prepared for deep questions
Potential Questions to Prepare For:
- "What if the pilot fails?" (It's designed to learn, not fail)
- "How do we measure success?" (Predefined metrics and learnings)
- "What about our current projects?" (Gradual transition, not disruption)
- "Who would lead this?" (We need to identify internal champion)

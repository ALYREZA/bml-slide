# The Challenge: Why Must We Change?

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-8 text-left">

<div>

### The New Market Reality
- <carbon-rocket /> **Speed is everything:** Competitors emerge and evolve faster than ever.
- <carbon-user-multiple /> **Expectations are high:** Customers demand continuous improvement.
- <carbon-chart-line /> **Stagnation is failure:** What works today is obsolete tomorrow.

</div>

<div v-click>

### The Risk of Our Current Model
- <carbon-building /> **Building on assumptions:** High risk of creating products nobody wants.
- <carbon-currency-dollar /> **High cost of failure:** One large failed project wastes significant capital.
- <carbon-time /> **Slow to react:** We lose market opportunities while stuck in long development cycles.

</div>

</div>

# The Solution: A Cultural & Process Shift

::left::

### <carbon-idea /> 1. The Mindset Shift
From a finite **Project** with an end date...
<br/>
...to a living **Product** that evolves to create value continuously.

<br/>
<br/>

<div v-click>
  ### <carbon-user-multiple /> 2. The People Shift
  From "Feature Factories" executing a list of tasks...
  <br/>
  ...to **Empowered Teams** that own and solve real customer problems.
</div>

::right::

<div v-click>
  ### <carbon-chart-line /> 3. The Process Shift
From one big bet based on assumptions...
<br/>
...to a cycle of **Build, Measure, Learn** that uses data to guide investment.
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<div v-click>
  ### <carbon-idea /> 4. The Innovation Shift
  From staying in the "Safe Zone" of predictable ideas...
  <br/>
  ...to a structured way of exploring **"Out-of-the-Box"** concepts.
</div>

# 4. Fostering Innovation: Leaving the "Safe Zone"

<div v-click>

### The "Safe Zone"
- <carbon-locked /> **What it is:** Executing on known, predictable, incremental ideas.
- <carbon-chart-bar /> **The Result:** We get predictable, incremental results. It's crowded, and competitors live here too.
- <carbon-warning /> **The Danger:** We become easily copied and eventually irrelevant. True growth is impossible.
</div>

<div v-click>

### The "Growth Zone"
- <carbon-idea /> **What it is:** Exploring new, unproven "out-of-the-box" ideas.
- <carbon-chemistry /> **The Enabler:** The `Build-Measure-Learn` cycle is our **safety net**. It makes experimentation cheap and safe.
- <carbon-trophy /> **The Reward:** We find new revenue streams and create a real competitive advantage.
</div>

<div v-click class="col-span-2 mt-8 text-center font-semibold text-xl">
This framework gives us a safe way to explore unsafe ideas.

# 2. Empowered Teams (The "Who")

From a "Feature Factory" model...
...to a **"Problem & Solution"** model.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4">
<div>

### Old Way
- <carbon-list-checked /> Given a list of features
- <carbon-settings /> Execute orders
- <carbon-user /> No ownership

</div>
<div v-click>

### New Way
- <carbon-bullhorn /> Given a business problem
- <carbon-idea /> Discover the best solution
- <carbon-user-multiple /> Full ownership & accountability

</div>
</div>

<div v-click class="mt-6">

**Example:** Instead of saying "Build a new search filter"...
<br/>
...we say **"Reduce the time it takes for users to find a product by 50%."**

This shift unlocks creativity, speed, and leads to far better business outcomes.

# 3. Build-Measure-Learn (The "How")

The scientific method for reducing risk and maximizing value.

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6 mt-8">

<div v-click class="text-center p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">
  <div class="text-4xl mb-2"><carbon-code /></div>
  <h3 class="font-bold">BUILD</h3>
  A small version (MVP) to test one big assumption.
  <div class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Weeks, not months.</div>
</div>

<div v-click class="text-center p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">
  <div class="text-4xl mb-2"><carbon-chart-line /></div>
  <h3 class="font-bold">MEASURE</h3>
  Collect real-world data on how users behave.
  <div class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Data, not opinions.</div>
</div>

<div v-click class="text-center p-6 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">
  <div class="text-4xl mb-2"><carbon-idea /></div>
  <h3 class="font-bold">LEARN</h3>
  Analyze the data to make an informed decision: Persevere, Pivot, or Stop.
  <div class="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Learning, not failure.</div>

# Addressing Your Concerns

### "This seems unpredictable and expensive. Outsourcing gives me a fixed price."

<div v-click>

- A fixed price provides an **illusion of predictability**, but it doesn't remove the risk of building the wrong product.
- This model manages risk differently: we spend a little to **validate an idea** before spending a lot to build it.
- **The total cost of *discovering* a successful product this way is far lower than the cost of one big, outsourced failure.**

</div>

::right::

### "Why not just outsource development? It's simpler."

<div v-click>

- Our core product is the brain of our business. Outsourcing it is like outsourcing our strategy.
- The most valuable asset we create is **learning** about our customers and market. When we outsource, the vendor keeps that asset, not us.
- Building this capability in-house creates a **strategic advantage** that competitors cannot easily buy or copy.

# Action Plan: Our First 90 Days

To prove this model's value, we will launch a structured, 90-day pilot program.

<div class="grid grid-cols-4 gap-4 mt-6">

<div v-click class="p-3 bg-gray-50 rounded">
  <h4 class="font-bold text-sm">Phase 1: Foundation (Wks 1-2)</h4>

    <li><carbon-idea /> **Form Hypothesis:** Define a clear, testable assumption.</li>
    <li><carbon-document /> **Scope MVP:** Define the smallest experiment to test it.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div v-click class="p-3 bg-gray-50 rounded">
  <h4 class="font-bold text-sm">Phase 3: Execution (Wks 6-10)</h4>

    <li><carbon-document /> **Synthesize Learnings:** Document the outcome.</li>
    <li><carbon-arrow-right /> **Recommend Next Step:** Present a data-backed proposal to management.</li>

# The Ask

We are not asking for a blind leap of faith. We are proposing a small, controlled, scientific experiment to validate this approach within our own company.

<div v-click class="mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold">
  My request today is for your approval to begin this 90-Day Pilot Program next week.

# The Challenge: Why Change?

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-8">

<div v-click>

## Market Reality
- 🚀 Competitors emerge overnight
- 📈 Customer expectations constantly rising
- ⚡ Speed is the new competitive advantage
- 🎯 Traditional models are becoming risky

</div>

<div v-click>

## Current Limitations
- 📅 Fixed timelines don't match market pace
- 💰 High cost of building wrong products
- 🔄 No learning from failures
- 🎪 Building for yesterday's market

</div>

</div>

<div v-click class="mt-8 text-center text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600">
  "It's like trying to win a Formula 1 race with a family car"
</div>

<!--
The market today is fundamentally different. We risk building something perfect for yesterday's market, only to launch when the world has already moved on.

# The Solution: Product Mindset

<div v-click>

## From Project to Product
- 🏗️ **Project:** Defined start, end, budget, scope
- 🌱 **Product:** Living entity that evolves continuously
- 🎯 **Goal:** Achieve business outcomes, not just deliver features

</div>

<div v-click>

## Key Principles
- 🔍 **Problem-Focused:** Solve customer problems, not build features
- 🧪 **Data-Driven:** Build, measure, learn cycles
- 🚀 **Continuous:** Never "done," always improving
- 💡 **Empowered:** Teams own problems and solutions

</div>

::right::

<div class="flex items-center justify-center h-full">
  <div class="text-center">
    <div class="text-6xl font-bold text-green-500 mb-4">🌱</div>
    <div class="text-2xl font-semibold">Living Product</div>
    <div class="text-gray-600 mt-2">Like raising a child or tending a garden</div>
  </div>
</div>

<!--
A digital product is never "done." It's a living entity that must constantly evolve to meet changing customer needs and stay ahead of competitors.

# Build-Measure-Learn Cycle

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6 mt-8">

<div v-click class="text-center p-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">

## 🔨 Build
**Small MVPs**
<div class="text-sm text-gray-600">3 weeks, $30K</div>
<div class="text-sm text-gray-600">vs 6 months, $500K</div>

</div>

<div v-click class="text-center p-6 bg-green-50 rounded-lg">

## 📊 Measure
**Real User Data**
<div class="text-sm text-gray-600">How users actually behave</div>
<div class="text-sm text-gray-600">Not assumptions</div>

</div>

<div v-click class="text-center p-6 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg">

## 🧠 Learn
**Informed Decisions**
<div class="text-sm text-gray-600">Data-driven next steps</div>
<div class="text-sm text-gray-600">Minimize risk</div>

</div>

</div>

<div v-click class="mt-8 text-center">

## The Scientific Method Applied to Business
**Prevents massive failures by testing assumptions early**

</div>

<!--
Instead of spending 6 months and $500,000 building a full-featured product based on assumptions, we spend 3 weeks and $30,000 building a tiny version to test our biggest assumption.

# Problem & Solution Teams

<div v-click>

## Old Way: Feature Factory
- 📋 Management decides what to build
- 🔧 Teams get list of features to code
- 🎯 Goal: Deliver on time and budget
- ❌ No ownership or creativity

</div>

<div v-click>

## New Way: Empowered Teams
- 🎯 Give teams problems to solve
- 🔍 Example: "Reduce cart abandonment by 20%"
- 🧠 Teams research, brainstorm, test solutions
- ✅ Ownership leads to better solutions

</div>

<div v-click>

## Benefits
- 🚀 Faster innovation
- 💡 Better solutions
- 👥 Higher team engagement
- 📈 Improved outcomes

</div>

<!--
Instead of saying "build a new search filter," we say "customers are abandoning their shopping carts; find a way to reduce cart abandonment by 20%." The team is then empowered to research, brainstorm, and test various solutions.

# Addressing Concerns

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-8">

<div v-click>

## "It sounds messy and expensive"
- 💰 Fixed price = illusion of predictability
- ❌ High risk of building wrong product
- ✅ BML manages financial risk differently
- 📊 Spend little to learn a lot

</div>

<div v-click>

## "Why not just outsource?"
- 🏪 Core product = heart of business
- 🧠 Learning is our most valuable asset
- 🚀 Outsourcing loses knowledge and speed
- 🎯 Creates strategic capability competitors can't copy

</div>

</div>

<div v-click class="mt-8 text-center text-lg">

## "The total cost of discovering a successful product this way is often far lower than the cost of one big failure."

</div>

<!--
The predictability of a fixed-price project is attractive, but it's often an illusion. The price is fixed, but the risk of building the wrong product is incredibly high.
